00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:03,042
COMPLETED IN THE LUNAR LEAP MONTH OF 1966,

2
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:05,458
CC UNIVERSITY'S DA REN BUILDING
WAS SUPPOSEDLY BUILT

3
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:07,542
WHERE THE REALMS OF THE LIVING
AND THE DEAD MEET.

4
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:10,792
A FENG SHUI MASTER INSTRUCTED A BAGUA
DESIGN TO BE BUILT TO WARD OFF EVIL.

5
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,750
HOWEVER, IT WAS MALICIOUSLY INVERTED
UPON CONSTRUCTION.

6
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,792
SINCE THEN, THE DA REN BUILDING

7
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:18,917
HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY
COUNTLESS PARANORMAL INCIDENTS,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,708
BECOMING TAIWAN'S MOST INFAMOUS
HAUNTED BUILDING.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,375
<i>Kai, come.</i>

10
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:27,542
<i>Over there?</i>

11
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,458
<i>Can you tell me about</i>

12
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:32,000
<i>the Da Ren building legend?</i>

13
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:37,750
<i>I heard that the building's architect
had a financial dispute with the school,</i>

14
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,583
<i>so he changed the auspicious
bagua structure into an inverse one.</i>

15
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,542
<i>What does an inverse bagua structure do?</i>

16
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,542
<i>Does it mean ghosts can't get out?</i>

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,458
<i>And two, and three, and four.</i>

18
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:51,917
<i>Two, three, four.</i>

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,375
<i>Someone saw a ballet student</i>

20
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,042
<i>break her leg in multiple places.</i>

21
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,833
<i>And the haunted elevator.</i>

22
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:01,833
<i>Some people went in
and never came back out.</i>

23
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:04,042
<i>It's like it leads to another dimension.</i>

24
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,417
Do you think

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,042
this place is really haunted?

26
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,833
<i>Do you have to be so serious?</i>

27
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>Stop filming.</i>

28
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,042
<i>Okay.</i>

29
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:37,583
<i>Kai.</i>

30
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,708
<i>If you're going to test that game,
you must bring this.</i>

31
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:45,667
<i>It's an evil place.</i>

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,917
<i>I'm scared you'll break the taboo
of the Da Ren building.</i>

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,125
<i>Once it begins,</i>

34
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,250
<i>I don't know how it will end.</i>

35
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,833
LET LIGHT LEAD THE WAY

36
00:01:58,542 --> 00:01:59,750
<i>Remember.</i>

37
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,500
<i>Never let go of the blood lamp.</i>

38
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,542
"ELEVATOR RITUAL": TURN OFF POWER.
PRESS INTERCALARY MONTH FLOOR BUTTONS.

39

40
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:46,333
<i>I'm now inside the haunted elevator</i>

41
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,750

<i>In 2016, a series of campus accidents</i>

50
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,458
<i>took place at a private university
in northern Taiwan.</i>

<i>A male student, while filming
his gaming project at school,</i>

52

<i>was involved in
a bizarre elevator accident</i>

53
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,875
<i>and remains in a coma to this day.</i>

54
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,417
<i>Right after summer vacation in 2017,</i>

55
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,542
<i>campuses across Taiwan started to panic.</i>

56
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:24,875
<i>A public university in eastern Taiwan
suffered a shocking knife attack incident.</i>

57
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,083
<i>This year has been no exception,</i>

58
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,708
<i>with even more campus safety incidents.</i>

59
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:33,208
<i>A public university dorm in central Taiwan
collapsed in the middle of the night,</i>

60
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:35,625
<i>claiming the lives
of two exchange students.</i>

61
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,625
<i>At a renowned private school in the east,
a student died suddenly in the library</i>

62
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,458
<i>and was not discovered until the next day.</i>

63
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,167
Hello.

64
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,208
- I'm going on a delivery run. Bye.
- Bye.

65
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:11,292
<i>Ting, when will you get here? I'm thirsty.</i>

66
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,958
I know.

67
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:15,208
- I'm coming over now.
<i>- All right, I'll be waiting.</i>

68
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:17,042
<i>- See you soon.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

69
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:04,208
<i>I'm about to film our game-testing team.</i>

70
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,708
<i>Kai, are you sure?</i>

71
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,417
<i>Once it begins,</i>

72
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,833
<i>I don't know how it will end.</i>

73
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:14,417
<i>Are we really going to include this?</i>

74
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,333
<i>Isn't it a bit sensitive?</i>

75
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,500
<i>Then she shouldn't be working
on her brother's game.</i>

76
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,083
<i>She's the one who wanted to do it.</i>

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,542
<i>Still holding a grudge?</i>

78
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,500
<i>We all voted on it.</i>

79
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:29,208
<i>If Ting's brother hadn't already
made half the game,</i>

80
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,250
<i>we'd never have been able
to finish it in time.</i>

81
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,167
<i>Think about it.</i>

82
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,958
<i>Games based on true stories are popular.</i>

83
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:41,375
<i>Her brother was up late testing the game
when things went crazy.</i>

84
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,750
<i>It's gonna be viral.</i>

85
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,708
<i>Hong Jen Jiang.</i>

86
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,583
<i>You really need to think before you speak.</i>

87
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,417
<i>Look who's talking.</i>

88
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,875
<i>I bet Ting wouldn't mind.</i>

89
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,750
<i>What are you guys talking about?</i>

90
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,500
<i>You're finally here.</i>

91
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,833
<i>We're dying of thirst.</i>

92
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,083
<i>Your drinks are here.</i>

93
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,333
<i>Sorry I'm late.</i>

94
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,958
- I'll bring your drinks over.
- I'll get mine myself.

95
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:06,792
- Is my brother's video usable?
- It will be great for the intro.

96
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,833
Thanks.

97
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,750
It's finally ready.
Looks just like the one in the game.

98
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,292
Let me see.

99
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,417
- You made this?
- Yeah.

100
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,250
I've posted the game to the group chat.

101
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,083
Ting, take a look later.

102
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,667
See if anything needs fixing.

103
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,083
Okay. Thanks.

104
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:25,333
The mid-term presentation is tomorrow.
Let's go over it again tonight.

105
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:28,917
Tomorrow night, Ting will test
"One-Man Hide-and-Seek."

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,250
- Okay.
- Sure.

107
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,958
So…

108
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,167
Sorry, everyone.

109
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,167
I have to go again.

110
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

111
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:45,792
How's your brother doing?

112
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:50,167
He's okay.

113
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,333
Thank your uncle for me.

114
00:07:57,417 --> 00:08:00,917
The nurse he recommended
is really good. But…

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,125
If it's about the medical bills,
I can help.

116
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,708
No. Don't.

117
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,792
Everyone, I still have deliveries to make.
See you later.

118
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,542
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

119
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,083
You guys don't get Ting at all.

120
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,542
She'd rather sacrifice herself
to save her brother.

121
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:25,958
It's not fair.

122
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:28,458
Why don't you tell Jin to think
before she speaks?

123
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,375
<i>Hey, bro. Enjoying your snack?</i>

124
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,458
<i>I knew it!</i>

125
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,625
<i>I caught you, Mr. Greasy-hands!</i>

126
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,000
<i>Come check this out.</i>

127
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,000
<i>What is it?</i>

128
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,250
<i>This two-bedroom,
one-living-room property.</i>

129
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,458
"Can we afford to rent such a big house?"

130
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:45,750
<i>Of course! Listen.</i>

131
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:51,125
<i>This haunted building game I designed
is super scary and realistic.</i>

132
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,167
<i>Do you know what this game will do for us?</i>

133
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,125
<i>- What?
- We'll be successful.</i>

134
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,458
<i>We'll make big money.</i>

135
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:59,500
<i>It'll be a success!</i>

136
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:03,458
<i>Success!</i>

137
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,333
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

138
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:06,833
<i>Hey, take a look.</i>

139
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:09,375
<i>What? Is that okay?</i>

140
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:13,708
<i>Look, it needs to be done over there too.</i>

141
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,292
<i>Then you have to clean it.</i>

142
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,333
Our game is almost finished.

143
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,292
Our teacher says
a lot of companies like it.

144
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,375
You have to wake up soon

145
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,458
so we can go to the launch

146
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:49,292
and do a lot of things together.

147
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:51,708
You promised me.

148
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,458
Pinky promise.

was built in the 1960s.

161
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:23,167
It sits where the realms of the
living and the dead meet.

162
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,208
The school hired Architect Shu Wen Yen
to do a bagua design to ward off evil.

163
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:32,083
Instead, he designed an inverse bagua
that attracts evil spirits.

164
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:36,667
After killing his lover, Yu I Hsu,
he committed suicide in the building.

165
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,167
The school tried to suppress it
with incantations,

166
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,250
but paranormal activity
has not ceased since.

167
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:48,958
All the ghost stories in this game
really took place in the Da Ren building.

168
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:52,208
These ghosts have things
they cannot let go of,

169
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:54,167
just like people.

170
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,625
For the sake of proving themselves…

171
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,833
or protecting others…

172
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,167
<i>- Don't film here.
- Who cares?</i>

173
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,708
…they have fallen into an endless cycle,

174
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,625
reliving over and over their remorse,

175
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:27,667
resentment,

176
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,833
and regret.

177
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,208
The current version of the game

178
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:44,708
is based on the Da Ren building
alternate reality game (ARG).

179
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:49,167
Inside the game itself, players can
experience three urban legends.

180
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,458
"One-Man Hide-and-Seek,"

181
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,625
the "Four Corner" game,

182
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,208
and the "Elevator Ritual."

183
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,958
Summon the resentful ghosts in the game

184
00:14:58,042 --> 00:14:59,417
and defeat the final evil spirit

185
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,458
to rescue all the souls
inside the Da Ren building.

186
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:03,833
ARG SET IN THE DA REN BUILDING

187
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,167
Good. Very good.

188
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,292
I look forward to the game.

189
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,708
The building should be empty now.
Is everything ready?

190
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,417
Almost.

Ting? Good luck.

196
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,833
Let's start.

197
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,792
We're probably the only ones
who'd test a game in a haunted place.

198
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,958
Hong, focus.

199
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,167

REPEAT "I, [YOUR NAME], AM IT" THREE TIMES

00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,625
I, Ting, am it.

208

Where is it?

00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,167
<i>She's found the doll.</i>

226

<i>Well done! So realistic.</i>

00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:30,958

<i>It's over. What's wrong?</i>

242
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,667
Open up!

243
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,042
Hey, what's Ting doing?

244
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:02,833
Something's wrong.

245
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
What's going on?

246
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:05,625
Open up!

247
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:10,708
<i>Open up!</i>

248
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,417
- Careful.
- What happened?

249
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,542
Are you okay?

250
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,458
Why was I locked in?

251
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,458
Huh? You were?

252
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,583
The door's fine.

253
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,458
Could it actually be a real ghost?

254
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:33,333
- You're an idiot.
- Don't talk nonsense.

255
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,208
Then why wouldn't the door open?

256
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,083
What are you doing here after hours?

257
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,875
We're testing our project.

258
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,875
No one is allowed inside after midnight.
Understand?

259
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,125
Officer, we have to pack up first.

260
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,292
Now.

261
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:02,583
Immediately!

262
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:05,833
But all our equipment is in there.
Are you going to guard it all night?

263
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,708
Pack it up and go.

264
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,833
Did you see? His eyes were so weird.

265
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,708
I think he's on medication.

266
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,875
Plus, I've never seen him go home.

267
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,583
What a weirdo.

268
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,167
Let's go back and check
if the game has any bugs.

269
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,167
Ting, let's go.

<i>Welcome to </i>Spirit Detective.

<i>Today, I want to discuss

00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:09,292
<i>What is a living earthbound spirit?</i>

276
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,625
<i>What does this mean?</i>

277
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:12,125
<i>In this stage of samsara,</i>

278
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:15,667
<i>lost souls may be trapped in
a specific time and space,</i>

<i>unable to find a way out.</i>

280

<i>These souls are usually trapped
in a confined space…</i>

Bro, was that you?

282
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:38,292
BE…

283
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:41,000
Be careful.

284
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:53,250
Stop it!

285
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,333
Dad, stop it!

286
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:58,917
A 70, Ting.

287
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,125
Do you plan to rely on men
for the rest of your life?

288
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:04,958
- No.
- Be a shameless whore like your mother?

289
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,292
Ting, go!

290
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:08,917

You bastard.

293

You're no different.

294
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:16,708
<i>So what you're saying is,</i>

295
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:19,875
<i>if his body is still around,</i>

296
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:23,583
<i>his soul could return to his body?</i>

297
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:28,667
<i>We first need to distinguish between
living and deceased souls.</i>

298
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:33,208
<i>That is, if you are a living soul,
your body is still around,</i>

299
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:36,292
<i>but your soul is trapped somewhere else.</i>

<i>In this situation,
it is theoretically possible</i>

<i>for your soul to return to your body, but…</i>

Why is nothing happening?

316
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,167
What's going on?

317
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:19,458
What is it?

318
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,500
Ghost…

320
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,125
Go.

321
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:45,500
My brother had an accident.
He left behind a lamp.

322
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:46,875
Not my problem.

- Go.

00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:54,667
My brother's in a coma.

325
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,000
I have to complete the game for him.

326
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:03,625
Go home.

327
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,125
Officer.

328
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:09,833
Sir!

329
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,625
Please.

330
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,167
You need to take the class seriously!

331
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,917
It's really interesting, isn't it?

332
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,917
Ting, where are you going?

333
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:35,917
What is it?

334
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,458
We're testing the game
at the library later. Remember?

335
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:42,667
I need to look for something
for my brother.

336
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,083
I…

337
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:50,458
I feel like my brother
is still inside the Da Ren building.

338
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:53,958
Isn't your brother in a care facility?

339
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,000
I'll see you at the library.

340
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,083
Thanks.

341
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:05,125
Can you hurry up? I've waited a long time.

342
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:08,750
You're ridiculous,
always making me come inside.

343
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,208
Bring it over.

344
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:12,208
Come get it yourself.

345
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:22,000
Just bring it over.

346
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:30,167
Why did you leave it there?

347
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:35,042
Weirdo.

348
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,125
NO ENTRY

349
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:25,917
Are you done?

350
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:27,583
Sorry.

351
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:33,042
Sir. I really need your help.

352
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:36,542
The lamp I told you about yesterday.

353
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,667
My brother left it in the elevator a few
years ago. Do you remember?

354
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:42,292
I don't know what you're talking about.

355
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:46,167
I haven't started work or eaten. I'll be
in the security room at 4:00 p.m.

356
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,333
Now, get out!

357
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:50,958
This is yours, right? I got it for you.

358
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,542
You eat first. I'll wait.

359
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:07,792
I can help hang up your clothes.

360
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:16,125
Did anyone see you come in?

361
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:17,208
No.

362
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,792
I don't think so.

363
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,125
Sir.

364
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,917
This is very important to me.

365
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,167
I think…

366
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,875
I think this lamp might be a clue.

367
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:37,083
I have to find it. Please.

368
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,458
Is this it?

369
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:57,833
Yes, this is it.

370
00:35:59,042 --> 00:35:59,958
Thanks.

371
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:01,250
Thank you.

372
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,667
You're not afraid of me?

373
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,542
When others see me,
it's like they've seen a ghost.

374
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:13,833
It doesn't matter to me.

375
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:16,792
What others say isn't necessarily correct.

376
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,875
What others say isn't necessarily correct,

377
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,750
or necessarily true.

378
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,333
- Hey!
- Bo Ru Meng.

379
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:39,500
- Sorry, Bo Ru Meng.
- Stop it! Let go of me!

380
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:43,875
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

381
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:46,000
Bo Ru Meng.

382
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:47,083
Stop it.

383
00:36:57,625 --> 00:37:00,292
Sorry. I mistook her for someone else.

384
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:04,167
Someone else? Are you blind?

385
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,417
That's enough.

386
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,458
Is this what you were looking for?

387
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:15,833
What's the point of this?

388
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:17,417
Chen Wei Ma.

389
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,250
Why are you always so impulsive?

390
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:21,833
Give it back.

391
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:24,042
Ting.

392
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,000
Ting!

393
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:27,083
Hey!

394
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:31,917
So, are we testing
the "Four Corner" game or not?

395
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,542
Am I the one at fault?

396
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,750
Look.

397
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:09,583
That's where I designed the game.

398
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:11,792
CCU's Da Ren building.

399
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,417
Once I sell it to a gaming company,

400
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:17,958
the first thing I'll do

401
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:21,042
is buy a big house for you.

402
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,750
A big house?

403
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:29,958
Wouldn't cleaning a big house be a hassle?

404
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,250
Just a small apartment is fine.

405
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,417
You're such a downer.

406
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,417
What? I'm saving you money.

407
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,125
Bro.

408
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:47,958
Do you ever regret it?

409
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,292
Regret?

410
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,458
Regret what?

411
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,000
I often wonder…

412
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,958
if maybe Dad was just ill,

413
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:01,125
but we just didn't know about it.

414
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:09,167
Let's just make the best of our lives.

415
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,750
Who's there?

416
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,083
<i>Also classified as high-risk…</i>

417
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:23,500
Where's the remote?

418
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:31,875
No! This is an inverse bagua.
You can't get in.

419
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,375
You can't get in.

420
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,042
This is an inverse bagua.
You can't get in.

421
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,958
This is an inverse bagua.

422
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:07,917
You can't get in.

423
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:14,833
You can't get in. Yes.

424
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:17,917
This is an inverse bagua.

425
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,667
They can't get in here.

426
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:23,042
This is an inverse bagua.
They can't get in.

427
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,375
Where are you going?

428
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,042
No!

429
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:32,458
Damn!

430
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:34,208
You really freaked him out.

431
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:36,417
Do I really look that scary?

432
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,542
Isn't this going too far?

433
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:46,875
You're the one
who wanted revenge for Ting.

434
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:51,583
Ting, don't be like this.
They were just messing around.

435
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:53,000
Don't be like this.

436
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,292
Don't be mad.

437
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:56,167
Aren't you too old for this?

438
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,750
Why are you defending that pervert?

439
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:58,958
"Pervert"?

440
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:00,750
What you did was vile!

441
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:03,583
Ting, why are you so mad?

442
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,000
<i>We shouldn't have played the game.</i>

443
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:19,583
<i>We won't be able to get away.</i>

444
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:23,042
<i>Five people must die today.</i>

445
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:30,042
<i>According to quantum mechanics,
ghosts do exist!</i>

446
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:31,583
<i>Remember, don't count the steps!</i>

447
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:35,792
I don't want to go back.

448
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:37,833
I don't want to go back again.

449
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,667
I don't want… to be back here.

450
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,250
I don't…

451
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:43,500
De Cyuan Ji.

452
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:47,667
Five people must die!

453
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:55,375
Don't hurt Bo Ru Meng!

454
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,167
De Cyuan… help…

455
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,500
No. Come back.

456
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:12,042
Come back, you useless piece of shit!

457
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:13,500
Save her.

458
00:43:21,292 --> 00:43:22,625
Want to live?

459
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,875
You have to kill another five people.

460
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:38,083
No. No!

461
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:44,667
I'm not going to kill anymore.

462
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,292
What are you doing?

463
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:28,542
Why?

464
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:33,292
Why can't I kill myself?

465
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:38,417
What's the point of living like this?

466
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,333
Don't be like this. Get up.

467
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:50,375
Look at me.

468
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:57,125
I didn't know
what I was living for either.

469
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:00,103
It took me a long time to realize that

470
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:03,208
my mission in life was to save my brother.

471
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,375
I believe everyone has
a mission and reason for living.

472
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:12,875
Right?

473
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:30,000
EXORCISM SCRIPTURES

474
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:38,667
Why are you living in the Da Ren building?

475
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:44,292
The ghosts outside can't get in.

476
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:49,833
The ghosts inside also can't get out.

477
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:53,750
So the inverse bagua legend is real.

478
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:57,750
The actual experience is
even more terrifying.

479
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:16,125
These two people…

480
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,708
I owe them a lot.

481
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:21,917
I'll never be able to repay them.

482
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,000
I understand that feeling.

483
00:46:51,667 --> 00:46:54,000
Hello? What is it? I'm busy.

484
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:15,125
Sir. That was a terrible prank
we pulled earlier.

485
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:19,375
They put me up to it.

486
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:22,583
I was wrong to hit you.

487
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:24,750
Sorry.

488
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:26,333
But, sir,

489
00:47:26,417 --> 00:47:28,500
you shouldn't have hugged
his ex-girlfriend.

490
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Hey, Ting.

491
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:33,417
Why do you keep holding onto that lamp?

492
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,750
Remember how in the video
on my brother's phone,

493
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:45,083
there's a person
who wrote incantations on a lamp?

494
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:48,292
Later, I discovered
in my brother's notebook

495
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:50,250
that this lamp

496
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,833
can apparently ward off evil spirits.

497
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:57,167
There are some things I haven't told you.

498
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,458
When I tried out the "Elevator Ritual"

499
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:03,125
and tested "One-Man Hide-and-Seek,"

500
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:05,083
I ran into ghosts both times.

501
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:10,208
What are you doing?

502
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:19,167
Look. This is the secret code
my brother and I used as kids.

503
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:21,750
When I tested "One-Man Hide-and-Seek,"

504
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:23,333
I saw it on the door.

505
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:25,167
It means "be careful."

506
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,333
I think even though my brother
is lying in hospital…

507
00:48:28,417 --> 00:48:29,417
Ting.

508
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:31,958
Do you hear what you're saying?

509
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,708
I know it sounds crazy.

510
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,542
I didn't believe it at first either, but…

511
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:38,625
Ting.

512
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,875
You think his soul is trapped
in the Da Ren building?

513
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:50,167
The "Four Corner" game
summons evil spirits.

514
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:53,458
So eerie.

515
00:48:56,417 --> 00:48:57,917
Why are you telling us this now?

516
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:00,667
You're the one who wanted us
to make this game.

517
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:04,750
Why are you trying to scare us
with all this nonsense now?

518
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:06,542
Jin, what are you trying to say?

519
00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:08,750
Just quit if you want. What's your point?

520
00:49:08,833 --> 00:49:09,833
Ma.

521
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:12,625
I'm just telling it like it is.

522
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm not forcing anyone.

523
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:17,333
Besides, there have been
no incidents in the library.

524
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:18,667
Let's do it today. Otherwise…

525
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,375
All right, all right, it's okay.

526
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,250
Sir, we have to do it today.

527
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,042
Can we test the game in the library?

528
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:27,292
Please.

529
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:30,000
Can I not participate in the game?

530
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:34,583
Hong, I can assist you
at the control panel.

531
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:36,500
But it's the "Four Corner" game.

532
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,292
One room has four corners.

533
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,708
I'm on the control panel,

534
00:49:39,792 --> 00:49:41,625
so you have to be in the game.

535
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:43,167
Who else can do it?

536
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,667
Just in case, when we start testing,

537
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,167
we should bring the lamp.

538
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,042
Thank you, sir.

539
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:25,625
I'm worried you'll stir up trouble again,
so it's better if I stay close.

540
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,542
So, how do we start?

541
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:42,667
<i>Let's work with the security officer
and do a trial run first.</i>

542
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,500
Let's go.

543
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:50,500
Take this.

544
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:02,792
This one is called the "Four Corner" game.

545
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:06,625
<i>After turning off all the lights,</i>

546
00:51:06,708 --> 00:51:09,042
<i>the four of you are to each stand</i>

547
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:11,375
<i>in a corner of the room
facing the wall.</i>

548
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,583
Starting trial run.

549
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,625
When the game starts,

550
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:32,292
<i>remember to dodge the attacks in the game.</i>

551
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:35,375
<i>When you reach the next person,
tap their shoulder and say your name.</i>

552
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,125
<i>- If you reach an empty corner…</i>
- I'm Ma.

553
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:40,125
<i>…cough and light an incense stick.</i>

554
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:41,583
<i>And remember,</i>

555
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:42,958
no matter what happens,

556
00:51:43,042 --> 00:51:45,208
<i>you have to complete the four rounds</i>

557
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:48,375
<i>to summon the evil spirit in the game
and complete the mission.</i>

558
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:49,458
I'm Ting.

559
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:52,958
<i>I'll remind you once again.</i>

560
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:55,000
<i>If you reach a corner with no one there,</i>

561
00:51:55,792 --> 00:51:57,292
<i>remember to cough twice.</i>

562
00:51:58,375 --> 00:52:00,250
What if you forget to cough?

563
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:02,375
What you should be asking is,

564
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,750
if you don't hear a cough

565
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:06,917
<i>and only hear footsteps…</i>

566
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,667
That means there is now…

567
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:12,208
a non-existent fifth person.

568
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:20,417
Let's begin.

569
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,333
<i>Five,</i>

570
00:52:22,417 --> 00:52:23,417
<i>four,</i>

571
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:24,542
<i>three,</i>

572
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:25,833
<i>two,</i>

573
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:26,917
one.

574
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:35,750
<i>Sir, you go first.</i>

575
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,917
<i>Hey. Sir.</i>

576
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:06,167
You have to dodge the attacks.

577
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,208
<i>The "Four Corner" game is a team mission.</i>

578
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:10,083
<i>You'll drag everyone else down with you.</i>

579
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:14,208
What the hell am I doing?

580
00:53:26,542 --> 00:53:27,958
I'm De.

581
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:39,875
<i>I'm Ma.</i>

582
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:55,333
I'm Ting.

583
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:15,958
<i>I'm Jin.</i>

584
00:54:16,042 --> 00:54:17,167
That's the first round.

585
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,000
ROUND ONE OVER

586
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:34,958
I'm Jin.

587
00:55:01,542 --> 00:55:02,542
I'm Ting.

588
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:03,917
That's the second round.

589
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,292
ROUND TWO OVER

590
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:28,333
I'm Ma. That's the third round.

591
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:31,542
ROUND THREE OVER

592
00:55:33,042 --> 00:55:34,333
<i>Last round.</i>

593
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:36,917
<i>Complete this round
and the evil spirit will be summoned.</i>

594
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:39,917
I'm Ma.

595
00:55:59,042 --> 00:56:00,625
<i>Ting, who is that behind you?</i>

596
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,250
There's no one.

597
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:06,375
Where's Ma?

598
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:13,208
<i>Jin?</i>

599
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:18,375
Ting? Where are you going?

600
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:20,958
Hello?

601
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:22,833
- Anyone there?
<i>- De?</i>

602
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:35,542
Why aren't they in the corners?

603
00:56:42,708 --> 00:56:45,167
Why is the security camera moving?

604
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,917
Looks like…
it's coming toward us.

605
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,625
Quick, shut the door!

606
00:57:10,917 --> 00:57:11,917
Ting.

607
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:13,958
- Ting.
- Ting.

608
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,250
Ting?

609
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:29,208
Ting!

610
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:44,625
What is it? What's wrong?

611
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:47,375
Where is Yu I Hsu?

612
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,250
Ma.

613
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:58,750
Who is that?

614
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:01,833
Ting?

615
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,542
Where is Yu I Hsu?

616
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:30,583
UNKNOWN NUMBER

617
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:31,875
Who is it?

618
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:36,917
<i>Who is behind us?</i>

619
00:58:41,542 --> 00:58:42,625
<i>There's no one there.</i>

620
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:14,250
Run!

621
00:59:17,208 --> 00:59:18,333
Ma.

622
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:21,708
Ma!

623
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,250
Chen Wei Ma!

624
00:59:28,917 --> 00:59:29,917
Ma…

625
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:23,375
Help!

626
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:32,292
Help… me…

627
01:01:03,042 --> 01:01:04,167
How come…?

628
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:51,917
Come.

629
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,250
Get up.

630
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:04,667
Where is everyone?

631
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,458
Ma!

632
01:02:10,917 --> 01:02:12,125
Jin!

633
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:36,708
Heavenly Wang Ye,

634
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:42,208
please bless Ma, Hong, Jin, and Li
with a safe recovery in hospital.

635
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:44,625
Heavenly Wang Ye,

636
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:48,917
please bless Ma, Hong, Jin, and Li
with a safe recovery in hospital.

637
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,500
Heavenly Wang Ye,

638
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:55,167
please bless Ma, Hong, Jin, and Li
with a safe recovery in hospital.

639
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,708
Please bless Ma, Hong, Jin, and Li

640
01:02:57,792 --> 01:02:59,500
with a safe recovery in hospital.

641
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,500
Heavenly Wang Ye,

642
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:04,500
please bless Ma, Hong, Jin, and Li
with a safe recovery in hospital.

643
01:03:04,583 --> 01:03:06,458
- Please bless Ma, Hong, Jin, and Li…
- Miss.

644
01:03:08,292 --> 01:03:09,792
Sorry, but we're closing.

645
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:14,167
Okay.

646
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:15,667
Sorry.

647
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:27,708
Hello?

648
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:34,792
Kai?

649
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:35,792
Sis!

650
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:38,000
What happened?

651
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:39,500
They suspect it's a stroke.

652
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:42,292
The doctor said given Kai's condition,
we need to consider…

653
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:43,375
No.

654
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45,292
Ting.

655
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:47,583
Don't give up. I haven't given up.

656
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:49,292
Don't give up, you hear me?

657
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:21,125
Why is nothing happening?

658
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:25,375
Let light lead the way.

01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:51,875
Sir.

662
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:55,458
Sir. Can you open the door?

663
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,458
Sir!

664
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,583
Sir!

665
01:05:06,792 --> 01:05:09,125
Sir, please open the door.

666
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:10,500
Please.

667
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:12,917
Please, only you can help me.

668
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,292
Sir.

669
01:05:15,417 --> 01:05:17,792
Sir, please open the door.

670
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:21,208
Sir, please.

671
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,292
Please let me try one more time.

672
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:25,583
Sir, please.

673
01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:29,167
Do you know I almost got sacked?

674
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,667
Listen to me.

675
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:31,917
I was just at the hospital.

676
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,458
I think my brother…

677
01:05:35,625 --> 01:05:38,250
is trapped because
he left this lamp behind.

678
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,958
Without the lamp,
he can't find his way back.

679
01:05:43,542 --> 01:05:44,917
Sir, please. I beg you.

680
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,958
Please. I beg you.

681
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:49,917
He's critically ill.
He could die at any moment.

682
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,250
Please, let me try one more time.

683
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:54,083
I owe him so much.

684
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:57,292
Please, just let me try one more time.

685
01:05:58,458 --> 01:05:59,375
Please.

686
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:02,708
Can you please let me try once more?

687
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:04,583
Let me try one more time.

688
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:06,333
Let me try one last time.

689
01:06:06,417 --> 01:06:07,417
Please.

690
01:06:09,667 --> 01:06:10,500
Please.

691
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:12,083
Please, let me…

692
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:13,667
All right.

693
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:23,625
Do you feel better now?

694
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:36,042
It's fruit candy.

695
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:42,708
You thought it was medication
for mental illness?

696
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:48,833
Bo Ru Meng taught me this.

697
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:50,875
Her favorite was the red one.

698
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:52,667
Strawberry flavor.

699
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:10,167
You'll do anything to save your brother?

700
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:29,583
Regarding Shu Wen Yen,

701
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:31,333
I looked into him.

704
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:46,625
The ghost from the library?

705
01:07:50,292 --> 01:07:52,458
His soul is trapped here

706
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:55,167
inside the Da Ren building he designed.

707
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:57,083
Is it so that

708
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,792
he can be with Yu I Hsu?

709
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:28,417
Six, one, five, two, four, three.

710
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:04,375
That's it?

711
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,167
Let light lead the way.

712
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:36,000
This way.

713
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,333
Where to next?

714
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:05,625
No!

715
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:15,750
Run!

716
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,333
Light off.

717
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:39,542
She can't see us.

718
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:44,542
So, the one who just ran out
of the elevator was you.

719
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:52,708
Is this from the day I tested the game?

720
01:12:01,792 --> 01:12:02,792
Wait.

721
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:17,542
Look for my brother first.

722
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:31,958
There.

723
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:46,083
Let's go.

724
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,958
NO ENTRY

725
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:08,542
No way.

726
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:15,542
Let's go.

727
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:36,625
Let light lead the way.

728
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:48,292
Bro.

729
01:13:53,667 --> 01:13:55,167
Bro. Kai!

730
01:13:56,875 --> 01:13:58,333
Ting. Is it really you?

731
01:13:58,417 --> 01:14:00,958
Are you okay?

732
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:02,333
You shouldn't be here.

733
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:06,583
I'm here to take you back.

734
01:14:06,667 --> 01:14:08,250
Come back with me.

735
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:09,708
Come on, let's get out of here.

736
01:14:10,417 --> 01:14:11,542
Let's get out of here.

737
01:14:12,292 --> 01:14:13,167
Lamp…

738
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:14,292
What?

739
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:16,708
Soul…

740
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:20,125
Go now…

741
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:30,125
Bro!

742
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:33,417
Lamp…

743
01:14:38,625 --> 01:14:39,750
Bro!

744
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:43,750
Bro.

745
01:14:45,417 --> 01:14:47,500
Are you okay? Bro!

746
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:48,458
Are you okay?

747
01:14:48,542 --> 01:14:50,708
Are you okay, Bro?

748
01:14:50,792 --> 01:14:52,083
Are you okay?

749
01:14:56,917 --> 01:14:58,083
What's happening?

750
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:02,458
Bro.

751
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:04,167
Sorry.

752
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,250
Ting, I'm sorry.

753
01:15:08,333 --> 01:15:11,000
I'll go apologize to Dad first.

754
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:14,125
What are you saying?

755
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:15,208
Bro.

756
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,917
Don't leave me. No!

757
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:33,625
Don't leave me.

758
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,042
Don't leave.

759
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,667
When the lamp ran out of oil,

760
01:15:53,875 --> 01:15:55,250
your brother disappeared.

761
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:06,458
The lamp oil…

762
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:14,083
<i>Guided by blood.</i>

763
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:25,417
<i>Ignite the soul to suppress evil.</i>

764
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,042
<i>They suspect it's a stroke.</i>

765
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:29,667
<i>The doctor said given Kai's condition,
we need to consider…</i>

766
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:30,958
<i>No.</i>

767
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:32,042
<i>Ting.</i>

768
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:36,125
Use blood

769
01:16:37,917 --> 01:16:40,042
to connect the lamp and the soul.

770
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,333
Use the soul to suppress evil.

771
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:49,750
What you mean is

772
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:51,708
the lamp oil

773
01:16:52,167 --> 01:16:53,625
is your brother's soul?

774
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,750
In <i>Resentful Ghost Building,</i>

775
01:17:02,542 --> 01:17:04,917
every ghost and person

776
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,500
is trapped in a different dimension,

777
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:08,750
an endless cycle.

778
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:13,208
Let's go.

779
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,875
Hey, the lamp.

780
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:30,417
Where?

781
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:33,542
Hurry.

782
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:41,208
- Open up!
- What are you doing?

783
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:45,583
Warning myself not to break the lamp.

784
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:47,333
Break the lamp?

785
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:51,875
If the lamp doesn't break,
my brother can be saved.

786
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:57,833
Open up!

787
01:17:57,917 --> 01:17:59,125
Don't break the lamp.

788
01:17:59,917 --> 01:18:00,917
It didn't happen here.

789
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:05,042
Open up!

790
01:18:13,083 --> 01:18:14,583
Here. Hurry.

791
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,917
<i>Ting, who is that behind you?</i>

792
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:30,500
<i>It wasn't here either.</i>

793
01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:31,708
There's no one.

794
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:37,833
Wait.

795
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Now!

796
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:18,875
How come…?

797
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:42,167
It didn't break.

798
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,458
There's still oil.

799
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:45,625
It worked.

800
01:20:04,292 --> 01:20:05,875
I know where Yu I Hsu is!

801
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:10,167
Come on.

802
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:15,958
I know another exit. Let's go!

803
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,250
Wait.

804
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:27,833
Start over, again.

805
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:33,083
Come in!

806
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:40,750
Bro.

807
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:42,625
I knew you were still here.

808
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:52,625
Ting, listen.

809
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:55,792
No matter what happens later, you have to…

810
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:57,000
Why isn't it working?

811
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:58,083
What?

812
01:21:59,292 --> 01:22:00,292
I'll do it.

813
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:06,708
Six, one, five, two, four, three.

814
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:10,875
- That's strange.
- It still doesn't work?

815
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,583
- Bro!
- Ting!

816
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:22,208
- Bro!
- Ting!

817
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,833
The lamp!

818
01:22:26,917 --> 01:22:28,417
Bro!

819
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,792
Help!

820
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,083
Get the lamp!

821
01:22:39,667 --> 01:22:41,125
Ting!

822
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:48,125
The lamp…

823
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:53,875
Bro!

824
01:23:15,042 --> 01:23:16,792
Ting…

825
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:25,167
Bro!

826
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:28,083
Ting!

827
01:24:31,167 --> 01:24:32,167
<i>Bro!</i>

828
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:36,917
Hurry! Get it.

829
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,500
The lamp…

830
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,250
Kai! Wake up!

831
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:08,292
Kai! We're trapped in an endless cycle!

832
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:11,833
Kai!

833
01:25:50,458 --> 01:25:51,667
No.

834
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:54,500
No…

835
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:56,958
No…

836
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:01,625
Come here!

837
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:11,417
I'll strangle you!

838
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:17,708
Sorry.

839
01:26:17,792 --> 01:26:19,667
- Sorry.
- You two…

840
01:26:25,292 --> 01:26:27,125
Listen to me.

841
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:28,792
It was all me.

842
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:30,625
- But…
- Remember.

843
01:26:31,542 --> 01:26:33,208
It was all me.

844
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,625
No.

845
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:37,542
Keep on living.

846
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:42,500
Bro…

847
01:28:10,667 --> 01:28:12,500
Bro!

848
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:42,292
No vital signs. Doctor, no vital signs.

849
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:43,750
Hurry up, put it here.

850
01:28:44,292 --> 01:28:47,000
Please, get me the EMK and FAK.
No pulse, prepare for CPR.

851
01:28:50,208 --> 01:28:51,208
Hurry up!

852
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:08,667
- Isn't that a security guard?
- Yes, he is.

853
01:29:09,417 --> 01:29:12,625
May Kai follow
the Lord of Salvation's light.

854
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:17,125
Kai, follow the Lord of Salvation's light.

855
01:29:20,542 --> 01:29:23,792
May Kai follow
the Lord of Salvation's light.

856
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:24,917
- Bro.
- Kai.

857
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,958
Follow the Lord of Salvation's light.

858
01:29:28,042 --> 01:29:29,833
Press your hands together.

859
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,333
HSIN CHIAO CHAO… BO RU MENG…

860
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:47,542
WHEN PERFORMING DIVINATION,
PLEASE FOLLOW THE RULES.

861
01:30:53,667 --> 01:30:55,042
<i>Hit my head with it.</i>

862
01:30:55,125 --> 01:30:58,583
<i>- I said I'd protect you.
- Today, five people must die.</i>

863
01:30:59,125 --> 01:31:01,708
<i>Didn't you say you'd protect me?</i>

864
01:31:01,792 --> 01:31:03,583
<i>Remember, don't count the steps!</i>

865
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:05,917
<i>If you dump me like that guy,
I won't wait for you there.</i>

866
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,542
<i>No need to be scared.
I'll protect you if anything happens.</i>

867
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:09,833
<i>Go to hell then!</i>

868
01:31:13,042 --> 01:31:15,375
<i>There are feng shui structures
that gather wealth.</i>

869
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:17,000
<i>Do any gather negative energy?</i>

870
01:31:17,083 --> 01:31:19,792
<i>CCU's Da Ren building is one such example.</i>

871
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:23,375
<i>An inverse bagua, which doesn't
let ghosts get in or get out,</i>

872
01:31:23,458 --> 01:31:26,875
<i>is a structure
that gathers negative energy.</i>

873
01:31:27,542 --> 01:31:29,500
<i>Here we are in the urban area.</i>

874
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:32,667
<i>The building behind me
is over 50 years old</i>

875
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:35,500
<i>and also classified as
a high-risk structure.</i>

876
01:31:35,583 --> 01:31:38,333
<i>This building, due to
its large number of residents,</i>

877
01:31:38,417 --> 01:31:41,417
<i>has a wide range of differing opinions
among its occupants…</i>

878
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:57,042
<i>…and lower the owner consent threshold,</i>

879
01:31:57,125 --> 01:31:59,333
<i>thus expediting the process.</i>

880
01:31:59,417 --> 01:32:00,792
<i>I'm Shu Yu Lian of Gofun News,</i>

881
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:02,208
<i>reporting from Taipei.</i>

882
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:25,500
LET LIGHT LEAD THE WAY. GUIDED BY BLOOD.
IGNITE THE SOUL TO SUPPRESS EVIL

883
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Where?

884
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:35,958
Okay.

885
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:37,500
Okay, I'll head over now.

886
01:33:43,792 --> 01:33:46,583
My name is Wen De Ji.
I'm the new cameraman.

887
01:33:46,667 --> 01:33:48,042
You can just call me De.

888
01:33:48,125 --> 01:33:49,333
I'm Shu Yu Lian.

889
01:33:49,417 --> 01:33:50,792
Let's go to Minsheng North Road.

890
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:52,958
What are you shooting today?

891
01:33:53,042 --> 01:33:54,792
A drunk is causing trouble again.

892
01:33:54,875 --> 01:33:56,000
Let's go take a look.

893
01:33:57,167 --> 01:33:58,167
Okay.

894
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,333
You look kind of familiar.

895
01:34:02,708 --> 01:34:03,833
Really?

896
01:34:10,083 --> 01:34:11,417
Shu Yu.

897
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,292
Have you heard of Tung Hu University's

898
01:34:13,375 --> 01:34:15,542
Female Ghost Bridge legend?
